{"prompt": "Taylor Swift", "completion": "ssly? gaylor swift ?  bro r u a like a 14 yr old? or smth , Taylor's lawyers do more work than she does ,  #whitefeministsarethevictims ,Taylor Swift is so bland that even roasting her won't give her any flavor. , Tbh I think we're too harsh on Taylor for being a snake. How else would she be flexible enough to play the victim in literally every situation? It's really more impressive than anything else. , you  seem like a type of person who might cry when taylor breaks up ðŸ˜¢ ,Kanye west made her famous lol, do u share ur spotify with a girl with mental disorders . bro but on a serious note,apart from all this are u okay pls stop ,Your music taste is Taylor Swift-fangirl-obsessed-with-Ross-and-Rachel-unnecessary-reboot bad. Thank your Swiftie devotion for turning your Spotify into a cringe-worthy playlist. I hope you enjoy the endless loop of 'The Way I Loved You' â€“ the pinnacle of basicness."}
{"prompt": "Olivia Rodrigo", "completion": "Congratulations, your Spotify is Olivia Rodrigo-level obsessed. I hope your life drama is as thrilling as 'Nonsense' by Sabrina Carpenter. Your music taste is so predictable, it's like listening to 'Drivers License' on repeat during a never-ending teenage heartbreak."}
{"prompt": "The Weeknd", "completion": "Your Spotify is stuck in a 'Fair Trade' of mediocrity with The Weeknd. Listening to 'Save Your Tears (Remix)' with Ariana Grande won't save you from the monotonous sound of overplayed beats. You're on a musical rollercoaster, but the only drop is your taste."}
{"prompt": "Jass Manak", "completion": "Jass Manak, really? Your Spotify is drowning in the forgettable tunes of Jass Manak. I hope you find your way out of the musical abyss, but judging by your choices, you might be stuck in 'Albanian-pop-agenda' bad for a while."}
{"prompt": "Sabrina Carpenter", "completion": "Sabrina Carpenter? Your Spotify is like a bad sequel to a better artist's playlist. It's time to break free from the 'Moms-spaghetti' bad choices and explore some real talent. Sabrina Carpenter won't save you from the abyss of basicness."}
{"prompt": "Travis Scott", "completion": "Travis Scott? Your Spotify is so basic it's practically a meme. I guess 'lol Travis Scott...' is an accurate reflection of your musical depth. Time to trade in the auto-tune for some real talent."}
{"prompt": "Kanye West", "completion": "You wrote in Kanye for president? Your musical judgment is as questionable as Kanye's political aspirations. Your Spotify is stuck in a 'wrote-in-Kanye-for-president' level of bad. Maybe consider a more qualified candidate for your playlist."}
