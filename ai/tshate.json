As well as call her out for stealing another woman\u2019s man, but isn\u2019t that the entire plot behind \u201cSpeak Now\u201d the song.

I\u2019m hesitant to do so without making a concrete plan amongst the other mods, but here\u2019s a little more insight into things:\n\n\u2022\t\u2060First of all, the mods are busy. I recently got a summer job, another mod just moved, and in general everyone has a lot going on. This has been the case for a long time, but it\u2019s summer now, so we now more than ever have like. Lives to live and stuff\n\n\n\u2022\t\u2060The sub has become more and more unpleasant over time, likely due to its growth. The sub has had problems for years - the casual racism, the cattiness, and the stan behavior for example - but partially because of how large the sub has become, there\u2019s been an influx in these awful, discoursey threads. I\u2019m thinking of shit like the Macy Gray thread. Maybe it\u2019s because I haven\u2019t been around as much to take things down early, but there\u2019s been more and it just keeps being awful. I have had to show up, hours after the fact, and delete and ban fuckloads of transphobia, catfights, and just utter garbage too many times\n\n\n\u2022\t\u2060The last few days in specific have been just\u2026 a perfect example of many of the problems I\u2019ve had with the sub. The overused Taylor memes, the slur discussion, the fights, it\u2019s just been awful\n\n\n\u2022\t\u2060If you want to know what completely did the sub in, there was one dogwhistle of a report under the locked \u201cBeyonc\u00e9 copied Lizzo\u201d thread that pushed the active mods over the edge\n\nThere\u2019s a lot more I could say, but I just want to be done writing about this sub for right now.

I can only hope that she will wave goodbye to me as I choked to death and burn to a crisp on the boiling planet while the ship flies away. \n\nUj/ the people saying her mom needs to fly on a private jet because she\u2019s dying of cancer and can\u2019t fly commercial to and from her cancer treatments are sending me. The reaches some of them will go to. I love how we haven\u2019t heard anything about her mom in like 3 years, so they just automatically assume she\u2019s on death\u2019s doorstep. How grim.\n\nAlso, I like how her sub is more critical of this than popheads. Popheads is out there acting like it\u2019s literally impossible for her to fly commercial.

I learned from Taylor's interaction with Scooter that it's totally OK to publicly smear people you don't like and dogwhistle for them to be attacked by your fans.  If one of your crazy fans kills them, OH WELL!  ::shrug::  I also learned from Taylor about how to use breadcrumbing (dropping hints about your future releases) successfully and use [hidden clues](https://questioner.substack.com/p/the-infohazard-economy-part-2) and puzzles in order to turn your art into [an interactive game that your audience can participate in and engage with.](https://medium.com/curiouserinstitute/a-game-designers-analysis-of-qanon-580972548be5)  Naturally, it worked like a charm.
